# What is BMI? 
Body Mass Index(BMI) is value derived from person's weight and height. The result of BMI measurement can give an idea about weather a person has correct weight for their height.


# How to Calculate BMI?
BMI calculation is based on simple formula using person's weight and height. The formula for BMI = kg/m2 where kg is person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared. In simplified format it would be BMI = (Weight in Kilograms)/(Height in meters * Height in meters)

For example if person's weight is 68kg and height is 172cm then BMI = 68/(1.72*2) = 23

BMI calculator indicate whether person falls under healthy weight, underweight or overweight. If person's BMI is out of healthy range, their health risk may significantly increases.
